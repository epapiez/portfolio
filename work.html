                    the document viewing process, ended up winning the intern competition.

                    that promoted sustainability. A customer would purchase a resuable cup, and if they used that reusable cup at certain restaurants, they 
                    would receive a discount. It was essentially a membership service that promoted sustainability. We were able to get several restaurants
                    on board and actually created the cups. The presentation above actually includes my roommate holding a cup! We created social media, held
                    events at local establishments, and made a profit. We also made it to the final round of a pitching competition with our company.

                    on Brian Woodring's (pictured) projects. At the time, he was the Chief Technology Officer and currently holds the position of Chief Information
                    Officer. Throughout the summer, I worked on projects such as the analysis and presentation of survey results and the design of communication
                    for the CTO. I also participated in Hack Week, where I helped create a mentorship program.

                    I first created one for Brian Woodring. The presentation was shown to all technology leadership, including those at the C-level.

                    team used, I was able to continue working my internship while attending events before or after the workday. My favorite part of this 
                    experience was being able to speak to Facebook employees 1:1 to ask more personal questions regarding their role, their journey, and their passions.</figcaption>
