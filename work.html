          <figcaption><b>trucked up</b></br>For an entrepreneurship class (ES 212: Entrepreneurial Business Basics), I created a mock application in order to
            bring my team's idea to life. While my team and I created the business plan and pitch deck for our idea together, I took the 
            initiative to create a demo.

          <figcaption><b>software engineering internship</b></br>I worked as a software engineering intern during the summer of 2020. Although the internship was remote, I was able to work
            with a team of three other interns to create a fully functional application that went into production. Our application, meant to streamline
            the document viewing process, ended up winning the intern competition.

          <figcaption><b>starting a business</b></br>During one of my entrepreneurship courses (PSYCH 223: Entrepreneurial Creativity), three of my peers and I created a company
            that promoted sustainability. A customer would purchase a resuable cup, and if they used that reusable cup at certain restaurants, they 
            would receive a discount. It was essentially a membership service that promoted sustainability. We were able to get several restaurants
            on board and actually created the cups. The presentation above actually includes my roommate holding a cup! We created social media, held
            events at local establishments, and made a profit. We also made it to the final round of a pitching competition with our company.

          <figcaption><b>special projects internship</b></br>In the summer of 2019, I intered as a special projects intern on the technology team at Quicken Loans. Here, I directly worked
            on Brian Woodring's (pictured) projects. At the time, he was the Chief Technology Officer and currently holds the position of Chief Information
            Officer. Throughout the summer, I worked on projects such as the analysis and presentation of survey results and the design of communication
            for the CTO. I also participated in Hack Week, where I helped create a mentorship program.

          <figcaption><b>internship connections</b></br>At my summer 2019 internship, I also had the opportunity to make lifelong friends and work with the Chief Information Officer
            at the time, Linglong He (pictured). I created a presentation analyzing the results of the quarterly technology employee survey for Linglong after
            I first created one for Brian Woodring. The presentation was shown to all technology leadership, including those at the C-level.

          <figcaption><b>entrepreneurship competition judge</b></br>While taking an entrepreneurship course (ENTR 490: Organizational Management in Startups), I was asked by the instructor
            to help judge a highschool entrepreneurship competition. This was a very rewarding experience and I loved seeing the amazing potential
            that all submissions had.

          <figcaption><b>facebook wayfinder</b></br>In the summer of 2020, I was invited to attend the Facebook Wayfinder conference.  Wayfinder is a three-day program that helps 
            students find their way in the world of tech, design, and engineering. With the "Choose Your Own Adventure" format that the Wayfinder 
            team used, I was able to continue working my internship while attending events before or after the workday. My favorite part of this 
            experience was being able to speak to Facebook employees 1:1 to ask more personal questions regarding their role, their journey, and their passions.</figcaption>
